      Allows the `v` char as a prefix in version option of the
      `operator-sdk bundle` and `operator-sdk packagemanifests` commands. The
      `v` char in version string, is extremely common, for example the `git describe`
      command produces an output like this: `v0.2.0-13-ga74dac1`. When version
      string with `v` prefix is given, the version will be normalized to be
      semantically valid.
